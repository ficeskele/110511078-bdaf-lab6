**Here is the scenario:** 

You are a poor dev and want to get into the door of a wealthy club, the wealthy club is gated by an NFT. Only those who hold this [WealthyPrivateClub NFT](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5e94B61BCa112683D18d5Ed27CebB16566E6d5ba#code) can walk into their secret club. The secret club consists of wealthy members who holds lot of [“Bank Token”](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7A81e50E0Ad45B31cC8E54A55095714F13a0c74e). Separately, the token is used to govern a Bank and they have recently released a new smart contract [BankWithFlashloan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xbe02727047fADd7fe434E093e001745B42C5F49B#code), adding a flashloan capability and with lots of Bank Token in it.
